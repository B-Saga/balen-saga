People know me for being a daring adventurer, a man without fear of the unknown, ready to tread on where no one has ever dared before. 

And I dare say, they are right! I am all of that! 

But I’m also not a fool, a dung-brained dimwit that can only see as far as his nose. A man without any kind of fear is a corpse that is not aware of its own demise. 

I can count with a hand how many times I’ve been afraid of something, and one of those times was when I tried to reach the southern continents by traversing through the Dead Expanse. 

The area has several names depending on which town you ask, but Dead Expanse is the most common of them, even in different languages. Why does it have the dreadful name? Not a single ship has managed to successfully cross it from one end to the other. Some have entered the dreadful waters and come back, narrating tales of gigantic sea monsters and storms filled with banshee’s screams.

I thought of myself capable enough to try my hand at it, because I’m Hosier Sion, if I had traveled through the Dragon’s Throne on Zenria and the Savage Lands on Balenvhein, I was sure I could best the Dead Expanse, after all, we had the powerful magic of a divine vessel, something most explorer ships do not have. 

Aboard one of my most durable ships, the Crystal Skull, we departed from Zemanruge in the Wyrmstone archipelago, aiming to reach one of the mysterious kingdoms of the southern continents. Perhaps the Ashahai Kingdom? or the Blackwall Principate? Those were places we had only heard from the merchants that were able to make it to the Rodorian Empire from the Wet Steps, and we aimed to return to our homes knowing a lot more than just passing gossip. 

The Crystal Skull was a ship reinforced with arcana, and we had three arcanists in the ship: Halyn of Valventia, a street urchin I recruited a couple of years ago from a rundown town in the empire. Citro Cotta, the divine vessel of Ahti, one of the mercenaries we contracted for this expedition, and yours truly, the lucky divine vessel of Hermes and Lamlha. 

When we left vaelrian waters and passed through the Narrow Sea, what greeted us was the vast nothingness of the Dead Expanse. Miles upon miles of absolutely nothing. The water was different, a deeper shade of blue than the Narrow Sea, and the nights were much, mucho colder. 

The first three days were fine, we sailed at a normal speed, not wanting to push ourselves more than necessary by accelerating too much and perhaps being noticed by the gigantic monstrosities that survivors claimed existed withins these waters. At dawn of the fourth day we had our first encounter with the deadliness of the Expanse. 

### Part 2

One of our crew was on lookout duty in the crow’s nest of the ship when someone noted that he wasn’t in his post. We quickly checked that there was only a pool of blood in its place, without a trace of the body. We never knew what happened. 

Later that same day, two of our men went overboard when the ship was suddenly pushed from behind. The other two arcanists and myself went to check the waters for them, and in the dark waters we found not the drowning men but a gigantic deformed fish with dead eyes and an imposing presence. We left the waters and returned to the ship, commanding it to get away from that place immediately. We never found those men, let them rest within Namaenath’s song.

On the next day, we lost another two to a flying shark. We decided then to turn tail and run, but it wasn’t that easy, as the Expanse could feel our fears. 

The moment we turned back, we started to get attacked by different monsters of every shape and size every hour. Small sharks with long fins that allowed them to glide outside of water that were as agile as seagulls were the most common, but deformed gigantic groupers, massive squids and schools of millions of carnivore jellyfish were usual sightings. And the most unnerving thing were a couple of brilliant yellow eyes beneath the water that I could spot because of my abilities, but I never mentioned that to the crew, I didn’t want to scare them even more at the time. 

It all proved futile in the end though. A monumental typhoon closed in on us in a matter of minutes, where it had been sunny just a moment ago was now similar to the foot of a waterfall. 

The Crystal Skull was a mighty ship, but even the mightiest ships are not eternal. It carried us the best it could through the typhoon, while we fended off every creature that the Expanse threw at us, but during a moment of rest, I noticed that I couldn’t see the yellow eyes in the distance. Before I could warn the others, the waves beneath us trembled, and I only remember that I was sent flying several meters into the air. A humongous webbed arm was holding the Crystal Skull as if it was a toy, and slammed it against the raging waves. The yellow eyes were there, the owners of that powerful limb, and I felt its sight upon me before I lost consciousness from the earlier blow. 

I woke up with half my body atop a piece of driftwood, near the border of the Expanse. I was lucky that a group of bold illegal fishermen found me and healed me. It took me 2 months to recover from the blow that sent me flying and destroyed my ship. To this day, I don’t know if someone else from that expedition survived, and I’m sorry to the families of everyone that followed me that day. 

But, that is the life of an explorer, and even an unsuccessful trip can be considered an adventure in itself! Although, just to be clear, I’ll never go inside of the Expanse again, adventure or not.
