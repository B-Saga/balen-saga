After the death of Hrothgar Steinklad in the Battle of Maidenfield, the kingdom was thrown into disarray. Almost none of the members of the royal council expected their king to be slain by a foot soldier, much less that they’d lose a battle with winning odds while having a greater amount of arcanists in their numbers. 

The kingdom had managed to achieve military supremacy in their wars of conquest due to those two facts, arcanists and their king. Now, after Maidenfield, the throne of Vael Gahan was empty, and most of the arcanists who held commanding positions in the army were dead. 

Hrothgar Steinklad left the world with two legitimate male sons, Hrothgar and Arnwin. There were several bastard sons in the mix, as the late king was known to have a different bed warmer during each campaign, but the sons from Helaena Hravendux had already monopolized the support of all the involved parties so no bastard would ever hold a chance to seize the throne. 

Hrothgar was the vivid image of their father, and also the oldest of the pair, at 26 years of age. He was also a powerful pyromancer and a divine vessel, wielding the essence of Alaz, and was one of the commanders of his father’s army, and was also present in Maidenfield, but he was one of the few lucky survivors between the commanders there. His wrathful personality was also the talk of the commonfolk, as he had on several occasions executed people for slight offenses. 

Arnwin on the other hand, looked like a mix between their parents, with Hrothgar’s facial features but with his mother’s black hair and blue eyes. He was raised in Vael Gahan’s court mainly by his mother and grandfather, Oliver Hravendux, the regent of the kingdom during the king’s frequent absences. He was also a pyromancer and the divine vessel of Gibil, but unlike his older brother, he wasn’t renowned as powerful; of course, as a divine vessel, Arnwin was able to manipulate arcana to a high degree, but his overall ability was nothing special. Where his abilities shined were more on the side of his mother’s family: subterfuge. 

When the topic of the successor to the throne came during the first royal council meeting, most of its members showed support of Hrothgar, but then, Oliver Hravendux proposed that Arnwin be considered as a more suitable successor, his eloquent intervention and exposition of facts swaying several noble families to support Arnwin instead of his brother. The more loyal followers of Hrothgar were obviously enraged by this, and a brawl almost broke out in the middle of the council, but nothing happened in the end, and every councilor returned to their homes. 

But, the next day, the kingdom was in flames. 

### Part 2

After each councilor had left the meeting, they reconvened with their respective parties and strategized a hostile takeover plan, now that every side was already identified. The Hravendux family led the Arnwin party, with support from the Bërdgrens and Schildwachts among others, while the Gerlachs, Haltmanns and Issmids were the main supporters of the Hrothgar party, most of them being families that rose to power due to the late king’s actions. The Merehunds, the current most powerful family besides the royal family, were neutral at the start of the civil war.  

Hrothgar went into a rage when he learnt of what happened during the council, and tried to rally his supporters to immediately capture and execute all that supported his brother’s claim, but he was dissuaded by Hernjolf Gerlach and Nikolas Issmid, two of his most close friends. On the other hand, Arnwin left Vael Gahan during the night, and hid inside of Vranarsch, home of the Hravendux. 

After several days, the fleet of the Issmids blockaded Zemanruge and isolated the Bërdgrens, and the Schildwacht fleet had a quick skirmish with ships with the flags of the Haltmanns and even some with the Steinklad family flag. These small skirmishes quickly encompassed the entirety of the kingdom, and the annexed territories in the mainland of Balenvhein rebelled all at once, eager to get free of their new overlords that had lost their main symbol of dominance in the king. 

While Hrothgar led fleets and small armies into battle against his detractors, Arnwin traveled from village to village, garnering the support of the populace and small noble families. In a few months, Hrothgar found his soldiers starved and unable to pursue even small groups of enemies as he was not able to find merchants to supply him, nobles to house him or villagers to feed him; he could only forcefully seize their assets and in doing so, furthered his own bad image as the worst choice for the new ruler of the kingdom. 

Meanwhile, Arnwin visited almost every lord, village and company that had been wronged, making alliances and establishing agreements, hindering his brother at every step of the way. He also met with the Merehunds, and got their support with an agreement that would forever impact the history of the world: They would provide monetary and military support to Arnwin’s forces and will cede the island of Isvagar to the Steinklads, but in return, the Merehunds will gain independence from the Kingdom of Vaelris, and will retain their territory in the coast of Balenvhein.

With the Merehunds joining the fray, the already fragile balance between both forces crumbled and the supporters of Hrothgar began to switch sides, quickly leaving him with just a handful of forces at his command. The situation got to the point that some villages were openly hostile to Hrothgar and his forces; they had to rely on raiding ports and towns to get by, but desertion was an increasingly pressing issue. 

After a small-scale naval battle on the coast of Wrymfleugel, Hrothgar’s forces raided a nearby fishing village for supplies and recruits. When they arrived there, they found the village completely empty, but the coffers full of gold and the warehouses full of dried and fresh fish. Hrothgar, accompanied by Hernjolf, Nikolas and some of their household guards, reached the local hall, they found an empty building, but when they attempted to investigate what was inside, a single arrow pierced through Hrothgar’s chest, embedding itself on the ground with so much force that the floor cracked. 

Such an attack would have instantly killed a normal human, but Hrothgar was a strong arcanist, so he survived even though heavily wounded. Hernjolf then rushed to protect the prince, but then a majority of the guards started killing their companions, and Nikolas, a cryomancer, decapitated Hernjolf from behind while he was defending from one of the turncoats. 

Hrothgar was still lying on the ground when Nikolas approached him and froze his whole body solid with magic before shattering it with a kick. Thus the succession had been resolved, but it didn’t end with that. In every part of the archipelago, the staunch supporters of Hrothgar were killed all during that same day, either by personal guards, friends, family, even lovers. That day was known as the Day of the Dagger, and even though Arnwin was called a kinslayer for having his own brother killed, no consequence came upon him, as most of the people that were against him were now dead, and the surviving ones feared the invisible dagger in their backs wielded by someone close to them. 

Nikolas Issmid gained the nickname of “Black Ice” and was exiled from the archipelago for the crime of killing a royal, but his family gained considerable influence in the following reign of the now King Arnwin I “The Wordweaver”.
