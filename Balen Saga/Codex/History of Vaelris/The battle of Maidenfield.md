Hrothgar Steinklad’s conquest wars managed to extend as far as the eastern coast of Landerleier. By this time, the infant Kingdom of Vaelris already encompassed the entirety of the Wyrmstone archipelago, most of the central part of the continent of Balenvhein and part of the east of Landerleier. 

The expansion on Balenvhein was halted because of the presence of the Sundering, which reduced the habitable lands to the north, and forced the vaelrians to either conquest the forest of Lo’dihn to the west, home of the elves, or the Savage Lands to the east, which housed the remains of the Sunset Empire’s non-human slaves, like the brutal orcs or the wild ogres. At that time, Hrothgar decided first to deal with whom he was said to consider the biggest threat to his campaign, the also recently born Empire of Rodoris. 

The Rodorian Empire was built from the remnants of the escaped slaves from the ruins of the Sunset Empire, that joined the habitants of the farmlands of Landerleier and built a nation trying to emulate what the Sunset Empire once had. They controlled a vast amount of land, but their army hadn’t faced a significant threat since its birth, so their army, although numerous, wasn’t prepared to face the might of the Vaelrians, hardened by decades of continuous fighting after Hrothgar became King of the Archipelago.

This invasion of the Empire’s territory was called the Red Spring War, as this conflict started at the beginning of the spring of 347 AS and ended before the start of the summer of that same year. The forces of Vaelris, numbering the 30 thousand, marched against the 39 thousand soldiers of the Empire. The chosen place was Maidenfield, a very fertile land that was used for wheat before it had to be abandoned because of the war. 

Even though outnumbered, the vaelrians took the lead in the battle, with Hrothgar rampaging in the midst of the fighting, as he had done in every battle he was a part of since the start of his campaign. The king had gotten older though, with the hair in his head already white, standing at 63 years of age, 35 years after the start of the unification of the archipelago. Hrothgar was still a mighty force, a powerful and experienced pyromancer and geomancer, clad with his signature molten armor, a skill that would later become a clear sign of the Steinklad bloodline. 

But, the weak point of the vaelrian army was an over reliance on its arcanists and the chain of command. They had very few commanders in the field, all of them powerful arcanists, but continued success in war made them overconfident in the supremacy of magic, but arcanists in the end are still human. The rodorians had become aware of this fact during previous battles, and were ready to exploit it. 

The leader of the Empire, Emperor Dominius II, had prepared several small groups of their strongest arcanists and common soldiers spaced throughout the battlefield. When the commanding officers of the vaelrians had been identified after several minutes of battle, these special teams moved decisively to kill them. Using several predefined drum sounds, they knew where to move, and where to strike. 

One by one the commanders of the Vaelris Kingdom fell, until the army became a disorderly mess, and the still structured rodorian army managed to push back. The surviving teams then converged upon the location of Hrothgar Steinklad himself, who defeated two whole assassination teams basically by himself. The commander of one of those units, a peasant hastati named Klimmligar, engaged King Hrothgar along with the surviving members of his team. In a matter of seconds, he was the only one left, facing the king alone. 

Klimmligar was a middle aged soldier, not even an arcanist, just a hastati that had a great skill at leading and was skilled enough to be named a unit commander. He suffered deadly wounds from this encounter, losing an arm and having most of his body burned, with his armor fusing to his skin, and only managed to thrust his spear two times. But, the two hits connected, one struck the chest of the king, destroying a piece of his molten rock armor, and the other one struck again at the same point, now unprotected, piercing the heart of King Hrothgar. 

The battle then turned in favor of the rodorian army, having lost almost all of their commanders and their king. This would also mean the end of King Hrothgar’s conquest, and the empire retook the stolen territory from Landerleier, kicking the kingdom out of the continent. Klimmligar managed to live for two more years as the empire poured all its resources and healers into him, their first widely known hero of war, but he passed away from his wounds anyways, although not before leaving behind a letter to the senate about how to conduct warfare against an arcanist army, but this document has never been released to the public. 

The Battle of Maidenfield is nowadays used as a study on the mortality of arcanists in battle, of the influence of communications in war, and how to effectively use a chain of command in a large-scale battle.
