Many ages before the Sundering, true dragons nested in the Draken Islands. A mountain range full of active volcanoes, it housed the perfect environment for dragons to inhabit. 

But, perhaps because of the dwindling of food sources, or changes in the climate, but little by little the dragons migrated from the Draken Islands to destinations unknown, and left their lesser offspring behind, with the characteristic disinterest in most worldly matters. Wyrms are only native to the archipelago, with some subspecies of them being found in other locations but we can always trace their origin back to the islands. 

Wyrms are perhaps the closest to dragons in terms of physical resemblance, massive cold blooded lizard-like creatures with thick scales, powerful wings and the ability to use arcanas. The main differences, they are smaller, their scales thinner, wings weaker and their magic is of a lower grade; it’s almost like they are a lesser replica. Where dragons could easily be above 30 meters long, wyrms could at most reach 20 meters. 

The best way to differentiate a wyrm from a dragon is that dragons have 4 legs and a set of two wings, traditionally (although there are known exceptions to the rule such as Laivanaria the Sun Dancer), while wyrms have a set of two back legs and their wings are substitutes for the missing pair of front legs. Because of that, most wyrm species have small clawed fingers at the tip of their wings. 

The first human inhabitants of the islands came to understand the viciousness of this draconic variant the moment they stepped into its waters. Wyrms were so much of a threat that specialized hunters started to appear, and wyrm hunting became a respected and common profession. Wyrms on the other hand, although not actually as smart as humans, and nowhere near as wise as their ancestors, were still intelligent creatures; they knew that they wouldn’t be able to fight back against humans who were extremely more numerous and resourceful, so they started avoiding them, only targeting the local fauna of the archipelago. 

But, the fauna of the island wasn’t enough to sustain the lives of thousands of wyrms that required the equivalent of two whole sheeps per day. Slowly, their population started dwindling, until only a few hundred wyrms were left in the more remote islands of the archipelago, and the highest peaks of the mountains. Some even managed to learn how to briefly swim to include fish and other aquatic animals into their diet, becoming what people nowadays call Sea Wyrms. 

Unlike their much more aggressive but also tamable cousins, the wyverns, the wyrms have yet to be used as mount by another race, probably due to the fact that the dragon’s pride is still strong within them, but that hasn’t stopped people from trying to do so, although as an adventurer myself, I have to admit that the idea of using one of these pseudo-dragons as a mount is an attractive and ambitious prospect: Imagine how it would change warfare if, before any common foot soldier would swing its blade, barrages of magic would come pouring from the skies.
