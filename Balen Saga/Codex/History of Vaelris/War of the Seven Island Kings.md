### Part 1

During the Age of Magic, the fighting between the now known as Island Kings of the Wyrmstone archipelago had resumed, but it was almost fifty years later, during the start of the Age of War, similar to what happened to the rest of the world, every kingdom leveraged their now powerful arcanists to wage war against their neighbors, in a struggle for expansion that had never been seen yet.  

In the case of Wyrmstone, this was called the War of the Seven Island Kings. 

The Schildwacht of Wyrm’s Teeth, the Reef Kings. 

The Bërdgren of Zemanruge, the Iron Kings. 

The Voltavoire of Wyrmfleugel, the Thunder Kings. 

The Hravendux of Vranarsch, the Shadow Kings. 

The Eisvetar of Pratenhafen, the Pirate Kings. 

The Merehund of Isvagar, the Merchant Kings. 

The Steinklad of Vaelris, the Fire Kings. 

The conflict started when the Steinklads denounced the Eisvetar for plundering their trade route to Balenvhein. The Eisvetar, the last big pirate group of the archipelago, true to their moniker as the Pirate Kings were infamously notorious in the region due to their fleet of small but powerful ships that allowed them to hunt and plunder the whole region, although they usually avoided direct hostilities against other Island Kings, as two Island Kings fighting among each other usually invited other kings to attack the weaker party. 

The leader of the Steinklad, Hrothgar Steinklad, was a young ambitious arcanist that had journeyed the world before returning to Vaelris to assume the seat of head of the family after a bloody succession conflict. He was a double divine vessel, one of the first known ones in history, wielding the essences of Asmodeus and Atlas, and was famous because of his molten rock armor that made him a menace on a battlefield. The other thing that made Hrothgar famous was his temper, fiery and short-fused. So when the news of the Eisvetar plundering came to him, the Steinklad officially made a statement of them denouncing the pirates, but secretly deployed their fleet to Pratenhafen. 

This type of conflicts between Island Kings were usually resolved when one of them exerted their power upon another, then demanded reparations from the defeated one, and everything returned to normal. Sometimes the reparations included territory, sometimes ships, sometimes gold. This time however, Hrothgar Steinklad attacked the Eisvetar fleet in a direct confrontation near Pratenhafen. It ended up in total annihilation of the pirate fleet and the death of Rickard “Half-hand”, the family head of the Eisvetar, along with all of his male children.

The Steinklad’s fleet was smaller in size, but their ships were sturdier and more heavily armed than the Eisvetar’s ones that were built for fast traveling and small skirmishes. In the naval battle that ensued, the Steinklads engaged in direct confrontation, with a group of arcanists in the ships in the front, a tactic that Hrothgar learned during his travels in the north. The main arcanists in the frontline were also members of the Steinklad family, most of them pyromancers similar to the patriarch, a common characteristic of this bloodline throughout the years. 

As was to be expected, a fleet of warships with a powerful group of pyromancers on the front, including Hrothgar himself, decimated the fleet of the Eisvetar, who had arcanists of their own but no definite structure in their organization. This battle was known as the Battle of the Sinking Shield.

### Part 2

After the Battle of the Sinking Shield in 312 AS, Hrothgar Steinklad put the descendants of the Eisvetar family to the sword, and effectively destroyed a whole bloodline from existence. The Steinklads took control of Pratenhafen, and declared to the rest of the Island Kings that they were the new owners of the Eisvetar territory. 

Now, this was the first total invasion of a neighboring kingdom by one of the Island Kings, and most of them didn’t take nicely to the news that they were six now. The Voltavoire family, the Thunder Kings, denounced the Steinklads publicly, naming them “usurpers” and “enemies of the islands”. They tried to rally the other Island Kings to push back the Steinklads, pushing the fact that if they let one of them overtake another kingdom unpunished, then who knew who would be next. 

The Voltavoires, with their leader Wilenhad in the head, got the backing of the Bërdgren and the Schildwacht, who feared the Hrothgar’s ambitious personality, while the Steinklads promised to gift the Merehund with the exclusivity of the trade routes to the north of the archipelago, and got the support of the Hravendux by marriage, having the eldest daughter of the family marry Hrothgar. 

The fleet of the allied forces of the Thunder Kings were massive in number, the biggest seen so far at the time, rounding 150 warships, proper ones at that, not raiding ships like the ones from the Eisvetar. The forces of the Steinklads were also impressive, at about 110 warships, including the brand new flagship of Hrothgar, the Red Dread, a gigantic warship with space for at least a hundred sailors. 

Both fleets met during the Battle of the Pearl Coast, west of Wyrmfleugel, resulting in a stalemate that delayed the war for years. Each fleet was so decimated after the battle that it took them three years to return to a somewhat similar state. Of the Voltavoire alliance, the Schildwacht were the most hurt, as 30 of their 33 ships were destroyed during the battle as they faced the Red Dread head on, with Hrothgar sitting in the deck of the ship hurling magic in the form of molted stones to the Schildwacht’s ships, easily decimating them in matter of minutes. The only reason the battle didn’t tip into the Steinklad’s favor was that the Merehund ships couldn’t withstand the ramming from the Bërdgren’s ships and the Voltavoire’s outmaneuvered the Hravendux’s and managed to encircle a good portion of their ships while pouring arrows from every direction before boarding them. 

After the battle, each fleet continued to raid and attack coastal cities from their enemies, in a somewhat repetitive way, during the three years of reorganizing. The territory of each Island King didn’t change that much, with Hrothgar still able to hold Pratenhafen although the island was already facing famine as supplies were almost impossible to pass through the blockade of the Voltavoires. 

The Steinklads were the first ones to attack with renewed strength, doing a flash invasion of Wyrm’s Teeth and taking the whole Schildwacht family hostage, effectively removing them from the war, and during the same day, Hrothgar and a group of his most elite warriors and arcanists attacked Drake Nest, the capital of the Bërdgren. Houses, towers, inns, streets, ships, even the castle where the Bërdgren family lived were burning. 

It is a common tale that during the attack, most of the city was in flames, with the screams of people burning alive reaching all the way through Wyrmfleugel, where Wilenhad shivered as he could foresee his defeat at this exact moment. But besides the tales told by commonfolk, Drake Nest was indeed in flames, most likely a result of the abilities of the Steinklads, a bloodline blessed by the arcana of fire. 

The Bërdgren still tried to support their allies, the Voltavoire, but the damage caused by the enemy in a single night pushed them back with fear, and the amount of support they provided was nowhere near as it was before.

### Part 3

With the Steinklad alliance removing the Schildwacht from the scene, and crippling the Bërdgren, the Voltavoires knew they only had one shot at winning the war: Killing Hrothgar and purging the Steinklad family from the face of Balen. 

This was to be called the Battle of the Chasing Thunder, during the autumn of 316 AS. 

The remaining ships of the Voltavoire gathered and rushed an attack into Vaelris, breaking into Dragonmaw Bay and launching a foot invasion of the capital. They had received reports that Hrothgar was inside the city during this time, and their intention was for Wilenhad, the strongest arcanists of the Voltavoire, to be joined by several other powerful arcanists and assassinate the family head of the Steinklad. 

Wilenhad Voltavoire was known as one of the most skilled arcanists, an expert astrapomancer with immense destructive power, hurling literal lightning strikes at his enemies. Part of the success they had during the Battle of the Pearl Coast, defeating the ships of the Hravendux was due to Wilenhad. 

The problem with their plan was that Hrothgar was expecting this development. 

No one actually knows where the plan had come from, if it was from Hrothgar’s infinite confidence in his abilities, his wife Helaena’s underhanded planning as one of the Hravendux, or from Hrothgar’s council. Many have speculated upon that since ages, but there’s no way we’ll be able to know that truth, perhaps until we come upon an arcanist that can show us the distant past. 

The assassination group successfully reached Hrothgar in the ceiling of Vael Gahan during the night, where it is told that he smirked when he saw Wilenhad. The group consisted of around 14 people, all arcanists of renown within the Voltavoire family. They all died that day. 

Thunder and flame was visible by the people close to the castle, each clashing against each other in a show that lit up the sky. No one was witness to the actual fight except for Hrothgar, who descended from the ceiling with one eye less, but with the head of Wilenhad in his hands, with the neck so visibly torn that it was clear that it hadn’t been cut, it had been torn off. 

With the death of the head of the Voltavoires, the soldiers were quick to surrender when they were shown the lifeless head, but every Voltavoire soldier was quickly put to the sword. Hrothgar commanded that, from that day on, every person with the surname “Voltavoire” was to be executed on the spot. A purge followed. 

Some of the more distant relatives of the family fled to Landerleier, where decades later they became a respected family within the Empire of Rodoris; but for everyone else that stayed in the archipelago, or just couldn’t flee, death was their destiny. That day, the Voltavoire family was no longer, and the Steinklads had consolidated themselves as the main power of the islands. 

Hrothgar then declared himself to be the sole king of the islands, and created the Kingdom of Vaelris, encompassing the entirety of the Wyrmstone archipelago. The allies of the Steinklads were quick to show their allegiance, presenting Hrothgar with their crowns, while the Schildwachts and the Bërdgrens tried to negotiate their survival offering loyalty. It was accepted, as both families still exist today and are renowned members of the nobility of the kingdom, but most of their territories were confiscated and hostages from each family were taken. It would take years for both families to return to a safer and more stable state. 

The newly formed Kingdom of Vaelris, supported by Robyn Hravendux, father-in-law of Hrothgar, created its first set of laws while stabilizing the new territories of the Steinklad family. But meanwhile, Hrothgar found out something that was decisive to the history of the Age of War: He was unhappy whenever there wasn’t a war to be fought, and the realms would suffer for that.
