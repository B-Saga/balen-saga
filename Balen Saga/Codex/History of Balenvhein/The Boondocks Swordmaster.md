*By Majlad of Crowned Hill, head librarian of the Merehund Citadel. Excerpt of “Notable figures of the arcane society'', published in 788 AS. 

Some people from Balenvhein and the archipelago have heard the title of the “Boondocks Swordmaster”, but even fewer know that it speaks of a real figure that still lives in a remote town between the Silent Mountains and the Saldivar River.

Roderigo Lichtfunke, a low-born that gained himself a surname from the Grand Council of Centerhill because of his innate ability for death dealing with a sword in hand and similar prowess in training remarkable swordsmen, and the most grand feat of all, gaining that renown while being a normal human, an arcaneless. He rose to prominence during the civil war of the late Robenbaurt Kingdom in the northwest of Balenvhein, where he was reported to have slain at least 3 knighted nobles of the kingdom that tried to forcefully recruit him to their own lord’s forces, as he was already known by them as a famed swordsmanship trainer that owned a very successful academy. 

After the incident, he disappeared from the spotlight, only to return 6 years later, in the middle of the backstreets of Crowned Hill, where he had started another academy. The only reason people took notice of this lowborn was that several of his students ended up in remarkable positions throughout the republic, and even in neighboring territories. One of them, the now Grand General of the army of Centerhill, Eammon “Rainmaker”, who back then had just recently joined the army, was asked by the high command where he had learned such outlandish sword techniques that had placed him above peers that were much older and experienced; it’s said that the Rainmaker smiled proudly as he spoke of his master, as he had been planning of helping him gain renown. 

The old men at the high command then started tracing the origins of several people, men and women, young and old, mages and arcaneless, that seemingly came from nowhere and rocked their surroundings by pure skill. That gained Roderigo a summon from the Grand Council, who after learning of such a remarkable individual, granted him a lordship with the expectation of anchoring him to the republic. It's said that he only requested to be granted a small territory far away from the big cities, and that he should be allowed to accept or reject who he teaches; they agreed. 

Having taken on the surname Lichtfunke, this man returned to the town he was given, a small, nameless town in the middle of nowhere, and set up a modest academy at its highest point, where he lives to this day. The exact location of this strange master is kept a secret from most people, and even those who manage to learn of it by their own means where he lives are still not assured a place in his academy, as he is said to reject nine out of ten people who come for his teachings, mages and arcaneless, noble or lowborn; there are stories of some of the rejected magicians refusing to accept the rejection, and their corpses are buried just outside the academy grounds.
