Much is told about the Sunset Empire in history books, no matter where you are, you can always find a text by a scholar, an explorer or a priest that mentions something about the Sunset Empire. And it’s easy to understand, as most of the world was influenced by it. 

The name came from what the people of the region used to call the “Miracle of God’s mirror”, where the sunset light would shine through the top of the mountain called The Godseye and it would reflect in a massive radius around it, lighting every house and castle for a brief few minutes even brighter that during midday. Some claim that some sort of human made mirror had been placed above the mountain to produce this effect, but that was never proved, as the empire had strictly forbidden anyone from going to the mountains since the early years of its foundation. 

The Sunset Empire was created around 850 years before the Sundering, making it the oldest known human territory in history. The tribal kingdoms of primal Balenvhein were united during the course of several hundreds of years, until the creation of the Sunset Empire by a king named Ropasius Maerlin, also named as Emperor Ropasius The Gallant in some old books. 

Tragically, not much is known about Emperor Ropasius besides being the first leader of the Sunset Empire and that his progeny succeeded the throne for almost six generations until a rebellion from the eastern territories, what would today be the Savage Lands, deposed the Maerlins to put a distant cousin on the throne. 

Their expansion conquests lasted for six centuries, until 237 BS during the Sunset Conquest of the Bogs, where they conquered the wild savages, cannibals and pirates that lived in the southern part of Zenria. The empress at the time, Avitia Oriphone “Shipbreaker”, tried to push towards the north of Zenria, trying to annex the fertile territories between the Bogs and the Scorching Wastes, but the unlikely alliance between tribesmen and pirates managed to stop them in their tracks, as the supply lines of the empire were unable to be maintained through the rough and dangerous roads, ripe with aggressive wildlife such as crocodiles, wyverns, wyrms, goblins and more. One has to remember that by these times, arcana wasn’t yet present in mortals besides from dragons and their offspring, so managing these issues was impossible even for the powerful empire. 

By the end of the Conquest of the Bogs, the Sunset Empire dominated Balenvhein in its entirety, the northernmost islands of the Wyrmstone archipelago, the south of Zenria and some coastal subsidiary states in the north of Landerleier. It was mentioned that back then, it took three months to go from west to east of the empire. 

### Part 2

The occasians were a mixed bunch, but the core of the empire in their capital, Aurora, was mostly tanned-skin people, natives to what today is Inaera. These physical characteristics can still be found on the lands where the escaped slaves of the empire took refuge, mainly in the Rodorian Empire. 

From the creation of the Sunset Empire, the occasians traded in slaves. War slaves, debt slaves, slave camps, it was common that a noble household had more slaves in their retinue than free people. As anyone with even a bit of knowledge on society knows, this brought several conflicts during the entire existence of the empire. Rebellions were the most common type of armed conflict that occurred; exactly 179 major slave rebellions were accounted for in the surviving books from the years just before the Sundering. 

Slaves in the empire were used for all types of heavy labor, and the government officials didn’t shy away from exploiting them, but in hindsight, the inhabitants of the past territories of the empire have to be grateful for that, as the roads built by occasians have withstood until today, as well as dams, city foundations and even some forts. This, coupled with the technological advancements they developed in that era made sure that the Sunset Empire was overwhelmingly superior to their neighbors. 

No slave rebellion ever managed to accomplish its goals of freedom, but there were always some lucky ones that successfully escaped free of the grasps of the empire. The majority of escaped slaves ran off to the free cities of Landerleier, the furthest from the empire they could get, and continued to flock there for decades even until the great collapse. This slow migration helped immensely the free cities there, as these slaves were highly trained people in certain fields, like farming, mining, construction and herding. 

The advancement of technology in the empire was a priority for every emperor, right besides expansion. Aqueducts, paved roads, the carabus ships and hydraulic irrigation were some of their most influential contributions to the world, some of their works still functioning to this day. And one of the cultural groups that contributed most of the work to these projects were in fact, slaves, and several of said slaves ended up joining other kingdoms all around the world, there’s even been reports of occasian technology in the far midsts of the southern continents. 

The stability between the Empire and its slaves stayed in a tense situation up until the last century of its existence. A golden age came upon the Empire during the 35 AS, when the Empire housed an outrageous amount of renowned scientists, engineers, carpenters, stonemasons and more. Their arts underwent a magnificent transformation, and several historical pieces were made during this time, with most of them having the intervention of the slaves at the time. And the biggest, most ambitious project of all was the Pyramid of Lalli Tlahko.
