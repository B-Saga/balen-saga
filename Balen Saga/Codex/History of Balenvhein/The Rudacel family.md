On a rather small plot of land for an independent territory, deep in the middle of the Balenvhenian scramble, lives the Rudacel family, in a duchy of the same name. The Rudacel duchy and its family have been the masters of that land for almost five ages, and there’s one reason that such a small family could maintain their independence even in these times: Unquestionable power. 

The Rudacels are the most renowned martial family of the entire world, and they might not have the strongest army, nor the strongest arcanists, nor the biggest coffers, but the one thing they indisputably have is renown, renown as the craziest, most zealous group of arcanists and martial artists that there are. 

Their founder, Fargorn Rudacel, was a lowborn soldier from the Robenbaurt Kingdom that rose to commander through pure ability to handle a greatsword in battle. He was an arcanists, but according to the records, the only magic he was able to perform was basic body strengthening, which would have deemed him a mediocre footsoldier, but after almost a decade of accumulating military exploits, Robenbaurt’s leadership decided to offer him a noble title as a mean to tie him to the kingdom and not being tempted to defect to one of the neighboring kingdoms.

The newly appointed Count Rudacel then established a long-lasting dynasty that would continue producing amazing soldiers to the Robenbaurt Kingdom. Some used swords, other spears or maces, most of them were arcanists but even then, their non-arcanist family members all knew how to perform battle almost from birth. 

After the splitting of the kingdom, the head of the family at the moment, Count Jhinn II, announced that the Rudacel family was now to be considered a duchy, and that they were to be an independent duchy from that moment forward. After the splitting, when the new territories were defined, several kings and lords tried to become the Rudacels new liege, half of them through marriage offers and riches, the other half through force. But, none were able to subdue the violent and unruly family, as even when they had all the losing odds in a military conflict, every single battle became a bloodshow, as no Rudacel allowed himself to be defeated and still live, often rushing in suicidal charges that managed to kill several opposing soldiers. In the end, no one was willing to endure the costs it would take them to take the territory of the Rudacels, which was actually the smallest of the region. 

After that peace, the world started seeing members of the family everywhere that war was present. It didn’t matter if the war was between the pirate lords and nomads in Zenria, you probably could find a Rudacel in there, perhaps a couple of them, and it was also possible that they were on opposing sides of the battle. In a short span of time, the Rudacels became a family of mercenaries, obsessed with waging war and looking for every opportunity they could find to wage it, but not as a duchy, but as individuals. It’s even said that part of the coming-of-age ceremony of a Rudacel involves them traveling the world and accumulating feats of battle, which no one has been able to confirm so far, but would surprise no one, as this is truly a bloodline of insane warriors.
