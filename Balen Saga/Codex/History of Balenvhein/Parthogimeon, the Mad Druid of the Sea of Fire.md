*Excerpt of “The Sea of Fire situation”, author unknown, published in 428 AS. 

I greet you my king. 

As of right now, I’m sure you’ve already read about the ongoing situation with the Barunian Expanse of the elven forest, but as the commander of the kingdom’s forces present in the area, I felt the need to report directly to you. 

We arrived near the town of Arvae, where we joined with the militia forces comprised of all the nearby villages. They had engaged with a known druid called Parthogimeon, a healer and veterinarian that wandered around the area offering his services for hire. It was reported by the militia that the druid had gone insane recently, and started the forest fire in a fit of madness. 

We then marched towards the forest fire, with three hydromancers ready to extinguish the fire after which we would go to apprehend the druid for questioning. By the moment we reached the source of the flames, it was an inferno. The trees were spewing flames from inside its bark and the ground breathed out fumes; it was as if we had reached hell itself. The hydromancer’s powers were not able to extinguish the fire out of a single tree, as the water evaporated as soon as it touched any surface, and our healers had their hands full just keeping most of the group from collapsing by lack of breath. 

When we decided to turn back and request for further backup, the mad druid Parthogimeon appeared. He had become an avatar of fire, his skin looked like he was made from the insides of a volcano, his hair became pure embers, his eyes burning coals. He called out to us, named us destroyers of nature. One of my lieutenants made the mistake of engaging in conversation with the madman, and pointed out the irony of calling us “destroyers of nature” when he was burning an entire section of the world’s largest forest; the next moment, a pillar of fire that rose from upon the very ground turned my lieutenant to ash. 

The mad druid said that he’d burn the entire world, to have it reborn from the ashes stronger. I’m ashamed to admit that I ordered the retreat, as I knew that we were not able to face this calamity, and even more ashamed that only I survived in the end. This apology is not enough to face you, my king, thus I’ll take my own life as payment for that, and perhaps I’ll be allowed to ask for my men’s forgiveness in the afterlife. 

Let me finish this report telling you that this mad druid, Parthogimeon, is not to be considered a dangerous arcanist; this is a calamity in the form of a mortal, and should be considered on the same level as the incarnation of a deity. If not contained, this will be the end of the continent, and I hope that after my death, the kingdom will remain a monument to its own greatness. 

Long live Kravelt!
